Three scripts.

1. bash_aliases.sh
    - This is for creating all the common bash aliases I use. Should be run after the bash_profile.sh

2. bash_profile.sh
    - For adding to the .bash_profile or .bashrc or .profile
    - Add history settings, as well as desired bash prompt

3. bash_functions.sh
    - Add all the common bash functions I use

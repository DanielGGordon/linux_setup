Set up vim how I like it!

Make sure I have vim installed
Download and install pathogen
Download and install Vim-Airline
Download and install Vim-Airline themes
Create my .vimrc how I liked it

Potential issues:

1. Vim-airline theme now is 'murmur'. Looks like garbage unless you install the correct 
    font and change it in the terminal

2. Need to pick a normal looking airline theme that doesn't look like garbage

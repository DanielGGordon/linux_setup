# linux_setup
Repo placeholder for scripts to execute when starting a new linux environment

## Overview
There are a few scripts that can be run any time I set up on a new linux environment.
For simplicity, scripts for different utilities will be split up into different scripts

## Examples

Let's say I want to replicate my normal VIM setup. I want a script that will:
* Make sure I have vim installed
* Download and install pathogen
* Download and install Vim-Airline
* Download and install Vim-Airline themes
* Create my .vimrc how I liked it
